# Contributing Guidelines

If you're interested in contributing to this project, here are a few ways to do so:

- Bug fixes
  - If you find a bug, please first report it using Github Issues.
  - Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labelled `bug`.
  - If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, send a Pull Request from your own fork and mention the Issue number.
    - Include a test that isolates the bug and verifies that it was fixed.
- New Features
  - If you'd like to add a feature to the library that doesn't already exist, feel free to describe the feature in a new Github Issue.
  - Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labelled `enhancement`.
  - If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending too much time writing the code. In some cases, `enhancement`s may not align well with the project objectives at the time.
- Documentation & Miscellaneous
  - If you think the documentation could be clearer, or you have an alternative
    implementation of something that may have more advantages, we would love to hear it.
    - If its a trivial change, go ahead and send a Pull Request with the changes you have in mind
    - If not, open a Github Issue to discuss the idea first.

## Requirements

- Code must follow existing styling conventions

4. Make your changes and commit them.
5. Push your new branch to your fork. (e.g. `git push myname issue-12`)
6. Open a Pull Request from your new branch to the original fork's `master` branch.
