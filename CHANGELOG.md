# 2.28.2  (September 2024)

- [Update]: The new `OTSession` component now has an `applicationId` prop, replacing the `apiKey` prop, which is now deprecated:

```js
<OTSession
  applicationId="the application ID"
  sessionId="the session ID"
  token="the connection token"
/>
```

Vonage developers specify Vonage application ID (not an API key), along with a session ID and token, as OTSession props. If you include the `applicationId` prop, do not include an `apiKey` prop. This is a beta feature.

- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video Android and iOS SDK to version 2.28.1. See the [Android SDK release notes](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/release-notes.html) and the [iOS SDK release notes](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/release-notes.html).

- [Fix]: Updates react, react-native modules (and axios dependency), and replaces uuid with react-native-uuid. The fixes issue #769. And it prevents [an issue](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid/issues/375) that would result from using an upgraded version of uuid.

- [Fix]: Fixes an error that resulted if you set an OTPublisher event handler for `streamCreated` without setting one for `streamDestroyed`.

# 2.28.1  (September 2024)

- [Update]: The new `OTPublisher.setAudioTransformers()` method lets you set (and clear) audio transformers. One transformer, the noise suppression filter, is supported. To use this, call the `setAudioTransformers()` method of the OTPublisher ref, and pass in an array with one object that has a `name` property set to `'NoiseSuppression'` and a `properties` property set to an empty string:

  ```js
  publisherRef.setAudioTransformers([{
    name: 'NoiseSuppression',
    properties: '',
  }]);
  ```

  *Important:* To use this method, you must add the Vonage Media Transformer library to your project, separately from the OpenTok React Native SDK. See [Vonage Media Library integration](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/media-processor/react-native#vonage-media-library-integration).

- [Update]: This version adds support for enabling single peer connection for the client, by setting the `enableSinglePeerConnection` property of the `options` prop of the OTSession component to `true`. For more information see "Single peer connection" in [this documentation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/create-session).

# 2.28.0  (July 2024)

- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video Android SDK and iOS SDK to version 2.28.0.

- [Update]: The Vonage Video iOS and Android SDKs loaded by this version are reduced in size by removing Vonage Media Library code.

  **Important:** In order to use the `OTPublisher.setVideoTransformers()` method (which uses the Vonage Media Library), you must add the Vonage Media Library separately from the Vonage Video React Native SDK. For details, see [Vonage Media Library integration](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/media-processor/react-native#vonage-media-library-integration).

- [Update]: For Android, this version of the library requires a minimum Android API level of 24.

- [Update]: This version adds support for reading the Certificate Authority certificates in the trust store of the host so that it can use them as valid root certificates when connecting to OpenTok services.

- [Update]: This version adds support for Apple's requirement of the [signature for the SDK](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements).

- [Update]: This version updates a vulnerable Node module (braces).

# 2.27.6  (June 2024)

- [Fix]: This version fixes some iOS crashes that were introduced in version 2.27.5. Fixes issue #757.

# 2.27.5  (June 2024)

- [Fix]: This version fixes the `OTSubscriber captionReceived` event handler. It also fixes the `OTPublisher publishCaptions` option in iOS.

- [Fix]: Calling `OTSubscriber.getRtcStatsReport()` method was resulting in an error. This version fixes the issue.

- [Fix]: Setting the `enableStereoOutput` option of the OTSession component was causing apps to crash in Android. The custom audio driver (used in Android when the `enableStereoOutput` option is set) is broken. This version disables the `enableStereoOutput` option in Android.

- [Fix] The `subscribeToSelf` prop of the OTSubscriber component was not working. This version fixes the issue (issue #612).


# 2.27.4  (April 2024)

- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video iOS SDK version to 2.27.3. This version adds a [privacy manifest required by Apple's App store](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements). Issue #737.

- [Update]: The installation instructions in the README file are updated, with new details on required Android permissions (such as `android.permission.BLUETOOTH`).

# 2.26.2  (April 2024)

- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video iOS SDK version to 2.26.3. This version adds a [privacy manifest required by Apple's App store](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements). Issue #737.

# 2.25.5  (April 2024)
- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video iOS SDK version to 2.25.5. This version adds a [privacy manifest required by Apple's App store](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements). Issue #737.

# 2.27.3  (March 2024)

- [Update]: This version updates the Vonage Video iOS SDK version to 2.27.2 and the Vonage Video Android SDK version to 2.27.1. See their release notes for details:

  * https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/android/release-notes
  * https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/client-sdks/ios/release-notes

- [Fix] Toggling between a screen and camera video source for publisher caused apps to crash in iOS. This version fixes the issue (issue #710).

# 2.27.2  (March 2024)

- [Fix]: On Android, a screen-sharing OTPublisher (one with the `videoSource` setting set to `"screen"`) failed if the app did not have camera access permission. This version fixes the issue, so that screen-sharing can proceed without camera access permission.

*Note:* In Android 6.0 (`API Level 23`) and higher, the Vonage Video React Native SDK automatically adds the camera access permission. However, an app or user can disable it independently of the SDK.

- [Update]: Updates react-native and axios packages to fix vulnerable dependencies.

# 2.27.1  (March 2024)

- [Fix]: On Android, OTPublisher components failed with an error when either `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA` or `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.RECORD_AUDIO` were not `true`. This version fixes that, by having audio-only or video-only publishers skip the `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.CAMERA` or `PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.RECORD_AUDIO` check if the `videoTrack` or `audioTrack` property of the `properties` prop of the OTPublisher component is set to `false`. You can set these props to `false` based on these permissions:

```jsx
import { PermissionsAndroid } from 'react-native';
// ...

<OTPublisher
  properties={{
    videoTrack={{(Platform.OS === 'ios' || PermissionsAndroid.CAMERA)}}
  }}
/>
```

*Note:* In Android 6.0 (`API Level 23`) and higher, the Vonage Video React Native SDK automatically adds these permissions. However, an app or user can disable them independently of the SDK.

- [Fix]: On Android, setting the `videoTrack` property of the `properties` prop of the OTPublisher component `false` resulted in the app to crash. This version fixes the issue (issue #652).

- [Fix]: Fixes some TypeScript definitions (issue #725).

# 2.27.0  (March 2024)

This is the first client-sdk-video-react-native version of the React Native
SDK for the Vonage Video API. There is also an opentok-react-native package,

- [Update]: This version adds support for [end-to-end encryption](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/end-to-end-encryption). The `OTSession` component includes a new `encryptionSecret` prop, which you can use to set and change the encryption secret used by the local client.

- [Update]: This version adds a new `OTPublisher audioFallback` option, which supports both subscriber and publisher audio fallback. The `audioFallback.subscriber` property replaces the `OTPublisher audioFallbackEnabled` option, which is deprecated.
The OTPublisher component has new callback functions for publisher audio fallback-related events: `videoDisabled()`, `videoEnabled()`, `videoDisableWarning()`, and `videoDisableWarningLifted()`.

- [Update]: The `OTPublisher.setVideoTransformer()` method now supports the background image replacement transformer in Android (as well as iOS). And the custom radius option for the background blur filter is now supported in Android (as well as iOS).

- [Update]: The axios package is updated. This updates a vulnerable version of in the follow-redirects dependency.

- [Fix]: This version fixes some issues in the TypeScript definitions.
