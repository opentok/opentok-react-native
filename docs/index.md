### OpenTok React Native docs

## Basic sample

This simplest use of these opentok-react-native componenents:

```
<OTSession apiKey="your-api-key" sessionId="your-session-id" token="your-session-token">
  <OTPublisher style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }}/>
  <OTSubscriber style={{ width: 100, height: 100 }} />
</OTSession>
```

Replace `your-api-key`, `your-session-id`, and `your-session-token` with your
[OpenTok project API key](https://tokbox.com/account/),
an [OpenTok session ID](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/create-session/),
and a [token for the session](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/create-token/).

Note that you add the OTPublisher and OTSubscriber components and children of
the OTSession component. Use the `style` and `className` properties to use CSS
to adjust publisher and subscriber layout.

## Reference docs 

The OpenTok React Native library includes the following components:

* [OTPublisher](./OTPublisher.md) -- Represents an OpenTok publisher.
* [OTSession](./OTSession.md) -- Represents an OpenTok session.
* [OTSubscriber](./OTSubscriber.md) -- Represents an OpenTok subscriber.

It also includes an [OT](./OT.md) object that includes methods for logging.

For details on events dispatched by the OTPublisher, OTSession, and OTSubscriber
components, see [Event data](./EventData.md).

## Unsupported features

The OpenTok React Native library provides a React interface for using the
OpenTok Android and iOS client SDKs. The following advanced features of the OpenTok Android and
iOS client SDKs are *unsupported* in the OpenTok React Native library:

* **Custom audio drivers** -- An application using OpenTok React Native use the device microphone
to capture audio to transmit to a published stream. And it uses the device speakers (or headphones)
to play back audio from subscribed streams. However, you can set the `enableStereoOutput` property
of the OTSession object to enable stereo output.

* **Custom video capturers** -- (BaseVideoCapturer) -- The OpenTok React Native OTPublisher uses
the standard video capturer that uses video directly from the device's camera. However, you can set
the `videoSource` property of an OTPublisher component to "screen" to publish a screen-sharing stream.

* **Custom video renderers** -- The OTSubscriber and OTPublisher components implement a standard
video renderer that renders streams and provides user interface controls for displaying
the stream name and muting the microphone or camera. Publishers and subscribers use
  `mPublisher.setStyle(BaseVideoRenderer.STYLE_VIDEO_SCALE, BaseVideoRenderer.STYLE_VIDEO_FILL)`
  
* **Codec detection support** -- There is no way to detect
[video codecs](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/codecs/) supported on a device.

* **Scalable video for screen-sharing videos** -- [This](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/scalable-video/)
is not supported for screen-sharing videos.

* **Force mute** -- Clients using OpenTok React Native can be forced to mute
(by clients using the OpenTok REST API, server SDKs, or client SDKs). However, there is
no support for events and methods related to the
[force mute feature](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/moderation/#force_mute). 

* **Getting client capabilities** -- There is no method to determine whether the client
can publish or force mute, based on the roles assigned to the
[client token](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/create-token).

* **Reporting issues** -- There is no way to programmatically report that your app experienced an issue
(to view with [Inspector](http://tokbox.com/developer/tools/Inspector) or to discuss with
the Vonage API support team.)
 
* **iOS delegate callback queue** -- For iOS, you cannot assign the delegate callback queue (the
GCD queue). See the docs for the
[OTSession.apiQueue property](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/reference/Classes/OTSession.html#//api/name/apiQueue)
in the OpenTok iOS SDK.

* **Publisher audio level and video level events** -- These events (corresponding to the 
PublisherKit.AudioStatsListener and PublisherKit.VideoStatsListener interfaces in the OpenTok Android
SDK and the `OTPublisherKitNetworkStatsDelegate` protocol in the OpenTok iOS SDK) have not been
implemented.

* **API enhancements from OpenTok Android and iOS SDK v2.23+** -- These features include
per-subscriber audio volume control, scalable video support for screen sharing, and support
for publishing FHD (1920x1080-pixel) streams. These have not been implemented.

To build Android and iOS apps that use these features, use the
[OpenTok Android SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/android/)
and the [OpenTok iOS SDK](https://tokbox.com/developer/sdks/ios/).
